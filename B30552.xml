            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now the agreement that I make with every one is, that shall come to be cured for Bursten Bellies, or Ruptures. That no man shall give a farthing for my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines or pains till he hath been cured half a year.

I shall not require one Farthing till they have been Cured half a year so well, as well those that live in the Country as in the City, only I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire your Names and the places of your abode when the half year is expired. And then when you are Cured of your Rupture or Bursten Belly; when the half year is past, then the Rich shall pay me Forty shillings, the meaner Thirty, the Poor Twenty. In this manner I will undertake to Cure you from your Distemper, let the Rupture or Bursten Belly be neyer so big.</p>

            <p>And if any one live not here, they need not upon that account miss my assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for I can send them such proper Medicines, as they may cure themselves.</p>
            <p>I do also help such as have lost their seed, and make the spirit of married People rejoyce, being lost by what occasion soever, and cause them to be as sprightly as ever, this I can test<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if there be any one so spoiled by the foul Disease as that he cannot go out, I have convenience in my House for them, to cure them in eighteenor twenty days without danger. If any one hath been in any strange place and suspects himself infected with any distemper, let him but come to me, or send me his true Urin, and I will again restore him to his former health, by cordial Medicines in which is no danger.</p>
            <p>Therefore think not much to come to me where you shall certainly find your health, for I take away all sordid humours occasioned by the small Pox or <hi>French</hi> Disease, therefore tarry not too long till you are spoiled by other Practitioners, and then it will be worse to be cured.</p>
            <p>This is sufficient for such as love their health, and such as have been tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other Practitioners, I shall certainly reduce to their former health, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have been sweated, Fluxed, and lanced by other Doctors: I shall give you remedy by pleasant Medicines, that you your self shall wonder at it: some perchance may say these are but words, but I shall confirm them by actions.</p>
            <p>If any one be troubled with the Cancer, either in their Nose, Breast, Arms, or any part about them, I have a certain remedy without Cutting, which none hath that remedy but my self.</p>
